focus areas
how to do other versions (ie classic AT etc). code so it's flexible to do versions in the future
WA has to be outlined, goals, roadmap, how it can be integrated and see which code can be used
abstraction of builders to allow better usage and future customizability
Singleton best format going forward
	particularly in MP. like the reads are fine but writes could get complex
	managers in general could be organized and streamlined better



code improvement big things
how to better bug test in Unity
initiation combat scene is a mess
UI scripts all over the place and narrowly tailored in each case. might be able
to generalize them more but maybe not worth the time.
lot of to dos in scripts

Headless mode
AI needs a long term plan. what is there that can be reused
if doing headless sim mode, the state based system might not work due to needimg ienumerators to yield state transitions
will the notification system work? maybe be too slow



misc ideas
	things you like from isignia tactics
	way to have units drop into WA mode (either controlled or loaded from a player configs)
