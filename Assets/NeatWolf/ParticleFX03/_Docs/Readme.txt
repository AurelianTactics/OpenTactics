Magic - NeatWolf's Particle FX Pack 03

This FX Pack is mainly oriented to Fantasy Spells and magic

How to use:

- Open the NeatWolf folder in your Project View
- Open the desired category you have in mind: (eg: fog)
- Drop the prefab onto the scene, and you're ready to go!

All the assets are built to be as easily scalable and recolorable as possible.


Feel free to DUPLICATE the prefab and move it in another folder of your project if you like to make small adjustments: in the evenience you update the package you won't lose the changes: you'll get the new updated version of the prefab while still keeping your changes.
