Ideas for improvement

1. Format the docs.txt better
2. Consider a better system like readthedocs.io
3. Visual respresentation of key systems:
	How scene link
	How states link
	Gameloop

4. Key files that need to be improved (more coding related than doc related) and documented
	Calculation files
	CombatStateInit
	PlayerManager (probably most of the managers)
	Streamlining the UI: Ie so many different buttons and unclear what is used where
	Combat Text
	
5. Document beyond the summary of the class
	Document all methods, variables, and functions. Maybe a large language model can be used?

6. Organize the files in the project better

7. Many to do notes throughout the docs and code

8. Generate directory and match directory to code index labels in the docs in a streamlined way

9. Document key system design ways and how to implement better
	Singleton
	WA, Multiplayer
	Scriptable Objects
	Other big concepts
	Better sense of which files are used where
